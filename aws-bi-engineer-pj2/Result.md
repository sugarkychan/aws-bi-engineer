# Skill Gap Analysis (Output)
## Skill Gap Analysis: John Doe (CV) vs. Doctor Position

Based on my analysis of the CV (sample-cv-01.docx) and the job description for a Doctor (sample-job-description-03.docx), there are significant skill gaps that John Doe would need to bridge to be suitable for the Doctor role:

### Major Skill Gaps:

1. **Medical Education**: 
   - John has a Bachelor's in Computer Science
   - The Doctor role requires medical school education and medical licensing

2. **Clinical Experience**:
   - John's experience is in software development and technology
   - The role requires clinical evaluation skills and patient care experience

3. **Medical Knowledge**:
   - No evidence of medical training or knowledge in the CV
   - The role requires ability to diagnose health problems and administer treatments

4. **Surgical Skills**:
   - No surgical training mentioned in the CV
   - The role requires performing minor and major surgical procedures

5. **Medical Regulatory Knowledge**:
   - No indication of familiarity with medical regulations
   - The role requires compliance with governmental guidelines for medication

## Conclusion:
The candidate would need to complete medical school, obtain proper medical licensing, and gain clinical experience to be considered for the Doctor position. The current CV shows a career path in computer science and technology, which is fundamentally misaligned with the medical profession requirements.


# Training Recommendations (Output)
## Structured Learning Plan for Medical Education 

### Starting Point: MED 506 CLINICAL SKILLS I 

This foundational course will help develop essential patient-physician communication skills, including initiating sessions, building relationships, exploring problems, and understanding patient agendas. The course teaches the first steps of eliciting patient stories in a patient-centered manner and introduces initial components of physical examination. Documentation skills through patient notes will also be developed in this course. 

### Core Medical Knowledge Development 

#### First Semester Courses: 
- **MED 502**: Human Body Structure & Function (15 credits; 231 hours)  
- **MED 504**: Human Histology & Physiology (13 credits; 180 hours)  

#### Second Semester Courses: 
- **MED 601**: Metabolism & Nutrition - Study of biochemical pathways focusing on metabolic processes, including nutritional intake and energy-yielding processes  
- **MED 606**: Clinical Skills II - Building on Clinical Skills I, this course develops additional components of patient-centered history taking, treatment planning, and communication skills in specific situations  
- **MED 609**: Research Curriculum Evidence-Based Medicine - Develops research skills related to Evidence-Based Medicine, including critical thinking and research analysis  

#### Third Semester Courses: 
- **MED 704**: Neuroscience and Neurology - Interdisciplinary investigation of pathology, physiology, and structure of the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system  

### Licensing Requirements 

To practice medicine in the United States, the candidate must complete: 
1. USMLE Step 1 (covering basic sciences)  
2. USMLE Step 2/CK (Clinical Knowledge)  
3. USMLE Step 2/CS (Clinical Skills practicum)  

### Clinical Experience 

After completing the five semesters of Basic Sciences curriculum, the candidate will need to complete clinical rotations at affiliated teaching hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. This provides essential hands-on clinical experience required for medical practice. 

### Program Structure Benefits 

The Medical University of the Americas program integrates case-based learning and clinical skills development throughout the Basic Sciences curriculum. Learning objectives are fully integrated across all courses, allowing students to maintain perspective on critical learning objectives while being evaluated on patient-centered competencies.
